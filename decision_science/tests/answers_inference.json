    "MEDIAN_AGE": "\nIn a multiple regression, Median age seems to be positively correlated with number of incidents, \nmeaning: the older the population, the more incidents (stronger correlation than with PERC_OTHER_STATE_OR_ABROAD).\nHowever, when treated alone, Median age is negatively correlated to NB_INCIDENTS\n",
    "T_STAT": "\nThe t-stat for Median age is 1.82 in a multiple regression with the 6 factors mentionned above.\nIt is used to evaluate the statistical significance (trustworthiness) of  the regression coefficients.\nIt is calculated by dividing the coefficient for the considered measure (median age) by its standard error.\n\nThe t-score gets compared with values in the Student's t distribution to obtain the P value \n(which thus is a better indicator to judge the regression)\n\n",
    "P_VALUE": "\nThis p_value of 12.8% means that, even in the case when there is no correlation between our target and the median \nage (=our Null hypothesis), we would have about 12% chance to find the current values.\nSo whether at 95% or 90% confidence level, we would conclude that there is no proven correlation.\nWe would need to lower our expectations to 85% confidence level to conclude that there is a correlation - not recommended\n",
    "INCREASE": "\nHolding all other regressors constant, the total number of incidents on all the surveyed period \ndecreases on average by 2115 when the share of families with a married couple \nincreases by 1 percentage point in the district\n",
    "LIMITATIONS": "\nThere are mots probably correlations between the variables you considered: \nfor example, age (as in median age and % of 30-34)is not independent of the prevalence in the population \nof married couples or graduates.\nSo let's test for correlations before concluding anything"
